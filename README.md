# Hi there, I'm Gaotian Wang 👋

I'm a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Rice University, focusing on robot manipulation and planning in the [Robot&Pi; lab](https://robotpilab.github.io/) under the direction of Professor [Kaiyu Hang](https://hangkaiyu.github.io/).

## 🔬 Research Interests

- Robot manipulation and planning
- Solving manipulation tasks under different uncertainties
- Building robot skill-sets for integration with Large Language and Multi-Modal Models
- Soft robotics

## 🎓 Education

- Ph.D. in Computer Science, Rice University (2022 - Present)
- B.S. in Optical Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China (2018 - 2022)

## 🚀 Projects

- **UNO Push**: Unified Nonprehensile Object Pushing via Non-Parametric Estimation and MPC
- **Funnel for Robust Object Manipulation**: A system motion model for robust manipulation without prior knowledge of object properties

## 📝 Recent Publications

1. **UNO Push: Unified Nonprehensile Object Pushing via Non-Parametric Estimation and Model Predictive Control** (IROS 2024)
2. **RISeg: Robot Interactive Object Segmentation via Body Frame-Invariant Features** (ICRA 2024)
3. **Kinematic Modeling and Control of a Soft Robotic Arm with Non-constant Curvature Deformation** (ICRA 2024)

## 🏫 Teaching Experience

- Teaching Assistant for Algorithmic Robotics (COMP/ELEC/MECH 450/550) at Rice University
- Teaching Assistant for Deep Learning for Vision & Language (COMP 646) at Rice University

## 🌟 Fun Fact

When I'm not working on robots, I enjoy outdoor activities like mountain climbing, snowboarding, and skateboarding!
